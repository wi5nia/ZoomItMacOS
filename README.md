## Architecture

The application is built with modern Swift patterns:

```
Sources/ZoomItMacOS/
├── ZoomItMacOSApp.swift      # Main app entry point
├── AppDelegate.swift         # Menu bar and system integration
├── ContentView.swift         # Main user interface
├── ZoomController.swift      # Core zoom functionality
├── ScreenCapture.swift       # Screen capture using ScreenCaptureKit
├── HotKeyManager.swift       # Global hotkey handling
├── ZoomOverlayView.swift     # Zoom display and live zoom
├── DrawingController.swift   # Drawing tools and annotation
├── TextController.swift      # Text overlay and DemoType
└── SettingsView.swift        # Application preferences
```

### Key Technologies
- **SwiftUI** for modern declarative UI
- **Core Graphics** for drawing and rendering
- **ScreenCaptureKit** for efficient screen capture (macOS 12.3+)
